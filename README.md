# classifyArabicArticlesWEB
 In this assignment, I worked on building a text classification system for Arabic  articles in categories like economy, religion, and sports. I used machine learning to  train a model that could correctly classify articles into these categories. My steps  included cleaning and normalizing the text data, using TF-IDF for feature  extraction, and training an Support Vector Machine model for classification.  I created a simple interface using Flask, where users can upload Arabic text files  and get the category prediction instantly. I also handled challenges specific to the  Arabic language, such as removing stopwords, and normalizing different word  forms.
